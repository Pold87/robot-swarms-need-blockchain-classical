/**
 * @file <argos3/plugins/robots/e-puck/control_interface/ci_epuck_range_and_bearing_sensor.h>
 *
 * This file provides the definition of the sensor part of the range and bearing system.
 *
 * The range and bearing sensor/actuator pair allows robots to
 * sense other robots in their locality and exchange data with
 * them.  When the presence of a robot cannot be sensed anymore
 * (i.e., the sensing robot does not receive an IR beam from the
 * robot), the data sent over the local radio is ignored. Thus,
 * this sensor/actuator pair provides localization and local
 * communication to the robot.  The range of the sensor depends on
 * the robot type.  This sensor can receive only ONE message for
 * each time step.  For each message, the following data is
 * provided:
 *
 *  1) range (=distance) in meters relative to the sensing robot
 *  2) bearing horizontal (=angle) in signed radians relative to the sensing robot
 *  3) data (8,16,24,or 32 bits) transmitted by the other robot
 *
 * All this data is encapsulated in a
 * TRangeAndBearingReceivedPacket struct.
 *
 * The sensor provides a vector that holds the received
 * packets.  The vector can be accessed by calling the
 * CCI_RangeAndBearingSensor::GetPackets() method.
